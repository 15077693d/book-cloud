Twilight Visions,Therese Lichtenstein,art,en,9780520271272,"Through an examination of surrealist photographs, objects, exhibitions, activities, and writings, the essays in Twilight Visions, the beautifully illustrated companion volume to the exhibition of the same name, portray the French capital as a city in the process of metamorphosis-in a kind of twilight state. The Bureau of Surrealist Research, the major Surrealist exhibitions, and the photographs of Paris by Brassai, Andre Kertesz, Ilse Bing, Germaine Krull, and Man Ray, among others, all reflect the tumultuous social and cultural transformations occurring in Paris in the 1920s and 30s. Juxtaposing the strange with the familiar, they seek to break down repressive hierarchies. At the same time, they represent a desire to change the world through experimental activities. Introduced by Therese Lichtenstein, with essays by Therese Lichtenstein, Julia Kelly, Colin Jones, and Whitney Chadwick, this absorbing volume considers the social, aesthetic, and political stances of the Surrealists as they probed hidden aspects of the commonplace and blurred the boundaries between dreams and reality, subjectivity and objectivity.

Expo 67,Rhona Richman Kenneally,art,en,9781442660212,"Expo 67, the world's fair held in Montreal during the summer of 1967, brought architecture, art, design, and technology together into a glittering modern package. Heralding the ideal city of the future to its visitors, the Expo site was perceived by critics as a laboratory for urban and architectural design as well as for cultural exchange, intended to enhance global understanding and international cooperation. This collection of essays brings new critical perspectives to Expo 67, an event that left behind a significant material and imaginative legacy. The contributors to this volume reflect a variety of interdisciplinary approaches and address Expo 67 across a broad spectrum ranging from architecture and film to more ephemeral markers such as postcards, menus, pavilion displays, or the uniforms of the hostesses employed on the site. Collectively, the essays explore issues of nationalism, the interplay of tradition and modernity, twentieth-century discourse about urban experience, and the enduring impact of Expo 67's technological experimentation. Expo 67: Not Just a Souvenir is a compelling examination of a world's fair that had a profound impact locally, nationally, and internationally.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aal3Xm7WrewC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Velocity Revisited,"Irwin Wunderman, PhD",education,en,9781463437916,"This book presents a novel and unorthodox approach to the wave theory, attempting to explain complex physical phenomena and derive fundamental laws of physics using natural numbers. The book is an elaboration and expansion of work presented in “What is a Photon? (Wunderman, 2000) and “Planck’s Constant and Pi” (Wunderman, 2004) which introduced a new interpretation for the space between integers of the natural number counting system. Mechanisms of wave propagation provide the essence of this theory. In addition, foundations emerge from the natural numbers themselves. The thesis makes a distinction between indeterminism and lack of causality in de facto physical processes. This work utilizes an uncommon method to describe how a wave-front surface area grows. The theory can infer a slightly altered interpretation of how space progresses as a square law when advancing away from an origin. Section I and Section II present an overview of the analysis method. The analysis in this treatise derives circumstances for viably transmitted cyclic modes and the consequence of their existence. Section I addresses the motion of objects like spontaneous emission photons that propagate at the highest rate, light-speed C. Section II covers the relative motion of slower rest mass objects. This treatise does not analyze relative motion in the presence of fields like gravity that could act on the moving object. This thesis purports that our interpretation of relative motion, what we call inertial velocity, is best expressed quite differently than has traditionally been done. This thesis hopes to show that the speed of light should numerically be absolute unity, based exclusively on the mechanism by which area accrues on the information-transferring-wave-front generated by events on a moving object. This thesis hopes to demonstrate that a more general type wave description better satisfies portrayal of a photon’s “frequency”. The harmonic exponential function “e"" is therefore purported to be an inappropriate mathematical function for physically representing propagating waves, photon frequencies, electromagnetic-radiation, and affiliated cyclic phenomena. An appropriate function must involve a reaction that temporally follows an initiating cause and presents a response that includes effects of Planck's constant and indeterminism associated therewith. This theory presents such a function and the waves generated are called unified waves.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uUU_IoGPgAYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
Intermediate Statistics,Keenan A. Pituch,education,en,9781136677199,"James Stevens’ best-selling text, Intermediate Statistics, is written for those who use, rather than develop, statistical techniques. Dr. Stevens focuses on a conceptual understanding of the material rather than on proving the results. SAS and SPSS are an integral part of each chapter. Definitional formulas are used on small data sets to provide conceptual insight into what is being measured. The assumptions underlying each analysis are emphasized and the reader is shown how to test the critical assumptions using SPSS or SAS. Printouts with annotations from SAS or SPSS show how to process the data for each analysis. The annotations highlight what the numbers mean and how to interpret the results. Numerical, conceptual, and computer exercises enhance understanding. Answers are provided for half of the exercises. The book offers comprehensive coverage of one-way, power, and factorial analysis of variance, repeated measures analysis, simple and multiple regression, analysis of covariance, and HLM. Power analysis is an integral part of the book. A computer example of real data integrates many of the concepts. Highlights of the Third Edition include: A new chapter on hierarchical linear modeling using HLM6 A CD containing all of the book’s data sets New coverage of how to cross validate multiple regression results with SPSS and a new section on model selection (Chapter 6) More exercises in each chapter.

Cross-Cultural Design for IT Products and Services,Pei-Luen Patrick Rau,design,en,9781439838730,"With the increase of globalization of business and industry, IT products and services are often produced and marketed across geographical cultural boundaries without adequate consideration of culture. There is a high probability that IT products and services developed in one country may not be effectively used in another country, which may hinder their market penetration, sales, and use. Based on research and practice, Cross-Cultural Design for IT Products and Services provides a resource for human factors engineers, designers, and marketing professionals who define and develop IT products and services for the global market. With its extensive review of cross-cultural theory and cross-cultural design literature, it is also a resource for those who are interested in research on cross-cultural design. The book presents an overview of the dimensions of culture that have implications for human information processing and affective response. It examines a set of user interface design guidelines grouped into five areas: language, use of color, icons and images, navigation, and information architecture. Also, it addresses physical ergonomics and anthropometry issues. The text translates theory and guidelines into a practical methodology and discusses how to integrate methods of cross-cultural design into a standard engineering process for product development. The authors review and reappraise theories, models, principles, and techniques for design of IT products and services that will be marketed globally. They provide guidelines for user interface design across North American, Asian, and other cultures. Applying the guidelines within the methodological framework provided will enhance the usability and effectiveness of the IT product or service, and contribute to greater user satisfaction, increased productivity, higher sales, and lower product support costs.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=enqt_oAHCXIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Reframing Information Architecture,Andrea Resmini,design,en,9783319064925,"Information architecture has changed dramatically since the mid-1990s and earlier conceptions of the world and the internet being different and separate have given way to a much more complex scenario in the present day. In the post-digital world that we now inhabit the digital and the physical blend easily and our activities and usage of information takes place through multiple contexts and via multiple devices and unstable, emergent choreographies. Information architecture now is steadily growing into a channel- or medium-specific multi-disciplinary framework, with contributions coming from architecture, urban planning, design and systems thinking, cognitive science, new media, anthropology. All these have been heavily reshaping the practice: conversations about labelling, websites, and hierarchies are replaced by conversations about sense-making, place-making, design, architecture, cross media, complexity, embodied cognition and their application to the architecture of information spaces as places we live in in an increasingly large part of our lives. Via narratives, frameworks, references, approaches and case-studies this book explores these changes and offers a way to reconceptualize the shifting role and nature of information architecture where information permeates digital and physical space, users are producers and products are increasingly becoming complex cross-channel or multi-channel services.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zs0lBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

"Design, When Everybody Designs",Ezio Manzini,design,en,9780262028608,"The role of design, both expert and nonexpert, in the ongoing wave of social innovation toward sustainability. In a changing world everyone designs: each individual person and each collective subject, from enterprises to institutions, from communities to cities and regions, must define and enhance a life project. Sometimes these projects generate unprecedented solutions; sometimes they converge on common goals and realize larger transformations. As Ezio Manzini describes in this book, we are witnessing a wave of social innovations as these changes unfold—an expansive open co-design process in which new solutions are suggested and new meanings are created. Manzini distinguishes between diffuse design (performed by everybody) and expert design (performed by those who have been trained as designers) and describes how they interact. He maps what design experts can do to trigger and support meaningful social changes, focusing on emerging forms of collaboration. These range from community-supported agriculture in China to digital platforms for medical care in Canada; from interactive storytelling in India to collaborative housing in Milan. These cases illustrate how expert designers can support these collaborations—making their existence more probable, their practice easier, their diffusion and their convergence in larger projects more effective. Manzini draws the first comprehensive picture of design for social innovation: the most dynamic field of action for both expert and nonexpert designers in the coming decades.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BzfpBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Rediscovering Mrs. Murphy,Craig S. Austin,fiction,en,9781418453930,"Johnny Bates is incarcerated in the minimum-security correctional facility fighting boredom. One day he learns about an injustice that is being visited upon certain convicts in the maximum-security prison by one of the prison guards. Johnny decides he must be the one to right the wrong. To do that, he must return to maximum-security, to the Walls. Once again in maximum-security, Johnny happily reunites with his old friends from his earlier stay, both convict and guard. He works his way into the place and position he wants and needs in order to complete his mission, while here he learns again the habits of the officers and other convicts and plans the method by which he will put an end to the injustice. Inside the Walls, a lot has changed and Johnny finds himself violently thrust into the most recent problem confronting inmates as well as the prison administration, the problem of juveniles who've been sentenced as adults. The new trouble does serve to keep the attention of the security staff focused away from Johnny, so although it's a distraction, it's not as bad as it seems at first. As he told the warden, ""I'm glad I ain't your biggest problem no more."" Johnny manages to right the wrong, to wreak the kind of justice (punishment) that will be understood and accepted in prison culture, a culture which seems to be slightly out of step with that of free society, but upon closer inspection is frighteningly similar. The book illustrates that prison is not entirely a war between good (security staff) and bad (convicts), but a way of life with love and hate, fear and humor, and pleasure as well as hard knocks. In prison as well as on the outside, life is what you make of it with the cards you are dealt.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I6to6a9Eg_YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

"Indians, Markets, and Rainforests",Ricardo Godoy,nature,en,9780231505031,"This book addresses two important and related questions: does participation in a market economy help or hurt indigenous peoples and how does it affect the conservation of tropical rainforest flora and fauna? Oddly, there have been few quantitative studies that have addressed these issues. Ricardo Godoy's research takes an important step toward rectifying this oversight by investigating five different lowland Amerindian societies of tropical Latin America—all of which are experiencing deep changes as they modernize. Godoy examines the effect of markets on a broad range of areas including health, conservation of flora and fauna, leisure, folk knowledge, reciprocity, and private time preference. He concludes that, contrary to considerable anthropological theory, the effect of markets on the quality of life and the rainforest are often unclear or benign. Godoy uses multivariate techniques to examine the changes modernization has had on many indicators of the quality of life and the environment and concludes that the seeds of socioeconomic differentiation may already lie dormant in simple economies. The impact of modernization on lowland Amerindians is a topic of great concern to anthropologists, researchers, and policymakers in developing nations, and this book is a significant contribution to the debate about the likely future of indigenous people.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Bp7RDEZyxWcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Personal interviews and group discussions were conducted to gather information on the indigenous knowledge of this ethnic group. A checklist of ‘categories of plant use’ was developed and used to identify, categorize and document plant species in the Twanrakhola community. Altogether, 109 plant species belonging to 49 families and 84 genera used for a wide range of purposes in the community are recorded. The people are highly dependent on forest and forest products. Because of their long experience with forests, the ‘Bankariya’ people have acquired rich knowledge about the utilization of plant resources in various ways. The Twanrakhola community harbours a high diversity of medicinal plants and wild edible plants. Despite the gradual economic and socio-cultural transformation in the life style of the community members because of globalisation, the Bankariya people still possess substantial knowledge of plants and their uses. Sustainable harvesting of and trade in medicinal and wild edible plants could be a significant source of subsistence and income generation for the local population.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_fjaJ6XXAAQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Oxford Handbook of Sound Studies,Trevor Pinch,music,en,9780195388947,"Written by the world's leading scholars and researchers in the emerging field of sound studies, The Oxford Handbook of Sound Studies offers new and fully engaging perspectives on the significance of sound in its material and cultural forms. The book considers sounds and music as experienced in such diverse settings as shop floors, laboratories, clinics, design studios, homes, and clubs, across an impressively broad range of historical periods and national and cultural contexts.Science has traditionally been understood as a visual matter, a study which has historically been undertaken with optical technologies such as slides, graphs, and telescopes. This book questions that notion powerfully by showing how listening has contributed to scientific practice. Sounds have always been a part of human experience, shaping and transforming the world in which we live in ways that often go unnoticed. Sounds and music, the authors argue, are embedded in the fabric of everyday life, art, commerce, and politics in ways which impact our perception of the world. Through an extraordinarily diverse set of case studies, authors illustrate how sounds -- from the sounds of industrialization, to the sounds of automobiles, to sounds in underwater music and hip-hop, to the sounds of nanotechnology -- give rise to new forms listening practices. In addition, the book discusses the rise of new public problems such as noise pollution, hearing loss, and the ""end"" of the amateur musician that stem from the spread and appropriation of new sound- and music-related technologies, analog and digital, in many domains of life.Rich in vivid and detailed examples and compelling case studies, and featuring a companion website of listening samples, this remarkable volume boldly challenges readers to rethink the way they hear and understand the world.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KuRfLG0IedYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Loss of Confidence,David Brian Robertson,history,en,9780271044866,"As the oil shortages, inflation, and unemployment of the 1970s disrupted American lives and the Watergate scandal rocked the presidency, faith in the future of the nation and its leaders was severely damaged. This volume, which is the product of a unique collaboration of distinguished scholars from history and political science, offers a probing analysis of the causes, processes, and consequences of this erosion of faith in public solutions to our country's problems. At the beginning of the decade, a confident American public and its leaders still embraced the government activism that was the legacy of the New Deal. But grave doubts about the efficacy of public policy&—fueled by Watergate, Vietnam, stagflation, energy crises, and intensely controversial social policies&—undermined this public trust as the decade wore on, until by the end tax revolts were breaking out across the country. Describing government as the problem, not the solution, Ronald Reagan broke with tradition to set a political and policy agenda that has been dominant ever since. These experts from two disciplines bring their special insights to bear in dissecting the key developments of this decade that have transformed American politics in the last quarter of the century.

"""Rabbatz der Halbstarken""",Wiebke Westphal,history,de,9783656155560,"Studienarbeit aus dem Jahr 2010 im Fachbereich Geschichte Europa - Deutschland - Neuere Geschichte, Note: 1,0, Georg-August-Universität Göttingen (Seminar für mittlere und neuere Geschichte), Veranstaltung: ""Nierentisch und Tütenlampe"" - Zur Alltagsgeschichte der fünfziger Jahre, Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: Wer heute einen Blick auf die Bundesrepublik der 50er Jahre wirft, läuft leicht Gefahr, die Dekade angesichts heiterer Heimatfilme wie dem ""Schwarzwaldmädel"" aus dem Jahr 1950, strahlend weißer Persil-Hemden in den Illustrierten und fleißiger Hausfrauen wie ""Klementine"" aus der Ariel-Fernsehwerbung, nostalgisch als kleinbürgerliche Idylle zu verklären. Natürlich war ein Teil der 50er Jahre durch Nierentische und Tütenlampen geprägt – diese Elemente waren jedoch niemals die bestimmenden, sondern lediglich ein kleiner Ausschnitt aus einer viel breiteren Palette. Ein Blick auf die Gesellschaft der Bundesrepublik in den 50er Jahren ist immer auch ein Blick auf eine Gesellschaft ""nach der Katastrophe"". Nach horrenden Verlusten an Mensch und Material im Zweiten Weltkrieg leiteten die 50er die Rückkehr zu ""geordneten und gesitteten Verhältnissen"" ein. Die Wohnungsnot wurde langsam beseitigt, die Lebensbedingungen allmählich verbessert. Ehemalige Trümmerkinder, die jahrelang die Freiräume und Freiheiten der großstädtischen Ruinenlandschaften als ""Abenteuerspielplätze"" genutzt und genossen hatten, wurden im Zuge einer konservativen Werterestauration wieder verstärkt in Familie und Gesellschaft eingebunden. Die CDU/CSU erreichte unter Konrad Adenauer bei den Bundestagswahlen 1957, bislang einmalig in der Nachkriegsgeschichte, die absolute Mehrheit der Stimmen mit einer Kampagne, die den Namen ""Keine Experimente!"" trug – mehr als bezeichnend für den Zeitgeist. Und inmitten dieser neu und lieb gewonnenen Sicherheit erschien scheinbar aus dem Nichts eine Generation ""völlig verjazzter und versporteter"" Jugendlicher auf der Bildfläche und versetzte die Bevölkerung in Angst und Schrecken: ""Halbstarke"", unorganisierte Gruppierungen Halbwüchsiger, ""die in der Öffentlichkeit durch normwidriges, sinn- und nutzloses Randalieren friedensstörend auffallen und primitive Antriebserlebnisse befriedigen wollen.""",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eTin1Yogkv0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Länder - Neuzeit, Absolutismus, Industrialisierung, Note: 1,3, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Universität Hannover, Veranstaltung: Tierhaltung in der frühen Neuzeit, Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: Die Jagd wird von dem Zeitpunkt an, an dem sie nicht mehr als eine lebenserhaltende Notwendigkeit angesehen wird, vor allem von den Privilegierten ausgeübt. Die Auseinandersetzungen und Interessenskonflikte zwischen bäuerlichen Bevölkerung und Adel haben sich seit dem Mittelalter, im Bezug auf die Jagd, verschärft. Regelungen und Verbote seitens des Adels an die Bauern häuften sich und erschwerten ein friedliches Zusammenleben. Der Themenschwerpunkt, weshalb sich der Adel das Vorrecht zur Jagd sicherte und welche Belastungen die Untertanen dadurch erdulden mussten, sollen in der vorliegenden Arbeit untersucht werden. Ich versuche einen Überblick zu geben, auf welche Ansprüche sich das Jagdrecht gründete, warum der Adel es für sich in Anspruch nahm und wie es sich in der frühen Neuzeit entwickelte. Die Bedeutung der Jagd für den Adel und welche Interessen mit der Durchführung verfolgt werden, soll ebenso behandelt werden, wie die mit der Jagd verbundenen Belastungen, wie Frondienste und Wildschäden. Die verschiedenen Jagdmittel und der genaue Aufbau einer Jagd werden hier nur nebenbei betrachtet. Die verschiedenen Formen und Ausprägungen von Jagdarten werde ich nicht weiter beleuchten.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IpO6lKuhWmgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Still Fighting the Civil War,David Goldfield,history,en,9780807147948,"Newcomers to the South often remark that southerners, at least white southerners, are still fighting the Civil War -- a strange preoccupation considering that the war formally ended more than one hundred and thirty-five years ago and fewer than a third of southerners today can claim an ancestor who actually fought in the conflict. But even if the war is far removed both in time and genealogy, it survives in the hearts of many of the region's residents and often in national newspaper headlines concerning battle flags, racial justice, and religious conflicts. In this sweeping narrative of the South from the Civil War to the present, noted historian David Goldfield contemplates the roots of southern memory and explains how this memory has shaped the modern South both for good and ill. He candidly discusses how and why white southern men fashioned the myths of the Lost Cause and the Redemption out of the Civil War and Reconstruction and how they shaped a religion to canonize the heroes and reify the events of those fated years. Goldfield also recounts how blacks and white women eventually crafted a different, more inclusive version of southern history and how that new vision has competed with more traditional perspectives. As Goldfield shows, the battle for southern history, and for the South, continues -- in museums, public spaces, books, state legislatures, and the minds of southerners. Given the region's growing economic power and political influence, the outcome of this war is more than a historian's preoccupation; it is of national importance. Integrating history and memory, religion, race, and gender, Still Fighting the Civil War will help newcomers, longtime residents, and curious outsiders alike attain a better understanding of the South and each other.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GOpJQ5ud_2MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Diary of a Country Clergyman 1848-1851,James Reid,religion,en,9780773568136,"A crusty yet diffident Scot, James Reid began his career as a sectarian evangelical missionary. The diary finds him thirty years later as a moderate, if conservative, Anglican clergyman. Through this remarkable document, village routines and intrigues, as well as Reid's circle of friends and his clerical colleagues, come vividly to life. His private reflections on the tensions and growing pains experienced by the colonial church at a formative stage in its evolution, and his reaction to events on the wider political scene, give us valuable insights into his life and the times. Reid was a man of considerable complexity and his foibles and vanities are apparent in his narrative. The glimpses of his home life shed much light on gender relations and the history of the family. The diary has been edited and annotated by M.E. Reisner, who provides the background to Reid's narrative. Her informative biographical sketches, collected in an appendix, shed further light on representative local figures and the community dynamics of his town.

As this city emerged from the ashes of humiliation the church emerged, by God's hand, from of the humiliation of Jesus and the cross. Today the church emerges in a culture of power, humiliation, and fear. Paul's challenge for the church is to be mature and practice unconditional love. This love is permanent.

Local and Metropolitan Communication Systems,Toshiharu Hasegawa,science,en,9780387348841,"We are witnessing an ever-increasing thrust toward the era of multimedia information networks, largely spurred by the U.S. Government's proposal for the National Information Infrastructure in the fall of 1993. While more people are subscribing to the services of narrowband ISDN, the implementation of broadband ISDN by means of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) has accelerated since the formation of the ATM Forum in 1993. In the meantime, frame relay may prevail for inter-LAN connections. In the ""upper layer"" of the network, commercial use of Internet is rapidly emerging.

Excitable Cells in Tissue Culture,Phillip G. Nelson,science,en,9781468438031,"The tissue culture approach to the study of membrane properties of excitable cells has progressed beyond the technical problems of culture methodology. Recent developments have fostered substantive contributions in research con cerned with the physiology, pharmacology, and biophysics of cell membranes in tissue culture. The scope of this volume is related to the application of tissue culture methodology to developmental processes and cellular mechanisms of electrical and chemical excitability. The major emphasis will be on the body of new biological information made available by the analytic possibilities inherent in the tissue culture systems. Naturally occurring preparations of excitable cells are frequently of suf ficient morphological complexity to compromise the analysis of the data obtained from them. Some of the limitations associated with dissected prepa rations have to do with the direct visualization of and access to the cell(s) in question and maintenance of steady-state conditions for prolonged periods of time. Since preparations in tissue culture can circumvent these problems, it is feasible to analyze the properties of identifiable cells, grown either singly or in prescribed geometries, as well as to follow the development of cellular inter actions. A crucial consideration in the use of cultured preparations is that they must faithfully capture the phenomenon of interest to the investigator.

Effective Environmental Regulation,Halina Szejnwald Brown,science,en,9780275969714,"Challenging views prevalent among Western and Polish scholars, this book explains Poland's surprising success in developing effective environmental and occupational regulatory systems while achieving remarkable socioeconomic growth, despite the toxic legacy of the Communist era. It offers rich insights into the questions of how one can achieve both economic growth and improved environmental and safety protection, and of the extent to which regulatory systems can be transferred across national and cultural boundaries. The authors develop a theoretical framework for assessing regulatory success, then use it to analyze Poland's recent experience. Grounded in five case studies of recently privatized firms, the analysis also presents a new survey of privately owned firms, extensive policy and data analysis, and interviews with key policy leaders, entrepreneurs, and intellectuals. The book points to case-specific decision making and information richness as key dimensions of an effective regulatory system and considers in depth the extent to which information richness is culturally dependent, and hence its portability as a policy tool. Addressing regulatory issues that are specific to both the United States and the international development community, the book makes a significant contribution to advancing the theoretical and conceptual frameworks used to explain the success, or lack of success, of regulatory systems.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VAMiswlb60kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Although there is continued interest in synthetic and structural studies the last decade has seen a growing interest in the potential of organometallic chemistry to provide answers to problems in catalysis synthetic organic chemistry and also in the development of new materials. This Specialist Periodical Report aims to reflect these current interests reviewing progress in theoretical organometallic chemistry, main group chemistry, the lanthanides and all aspects of transition metal chemistry. Specialist Periodical Reports provide systematic and detailed review coverage of progress in the major areas of chemical research. Written by experts in their specialist fields the series creates a unique service for the active research chemist, supplying regular critical in-depth accounts of progress in particular areas of chemistry. For over 80 years the Royal Society of Chemistry and its predecessor, the Chemical Society, have been publishing reports charting developments in chemistry, which originally took the form of Annual Reports. However, by 1967 the whole spectrum of chemistry could no longer be contained within one volume and the series Specialist Periodical Reports was born. The Annual Reports themselves still existed but were divided into two, and subsequently three, volumes covering Inorganic, Organic and Physical Chemistry. For more general coverage of the highlights in chemistry they remain a 'must'. Since that time the SPR series has altered according to the fluctuating degree of activity in various fields of chemistry. Some titles have remained unchanged, while others have altered their emphasis along with their titles; some have been combined under a new name whereas others have had to be discontinued.

Fluoropolymers 2,Gareth G. Hougham,science,en,9780306469190,"The fluorine atom, by virtue of its electronegativity, size, and bond strength with carbon, can be used to create compounds with remarkable properties. Small molecules containing fluorine have many positive impacts on everyday life of which blood substitutes, pharmaceuticals, and surface modifiers are only a few examples. Fluoropolymers, too, while traditionally associated with extreme high performance applications have found their way into our homes, our clothing, and even our language. A recent American president was often likened to the tribology of PTFE. Since the serendipitous discovery of Teflon at the DuPont Jackson Laboratory in 1938, fluoropolymers have grown steadily in technological and marketplace importance. New synthetic fluorine chemistry, new processes, and new apprecia tion of the mechanisms by which fluorine imparts exceptional properties all contribute to accelerating growth in fluoropolymers. There are many stories of harrowing close calls in the fluorine chemistry lab, especially from the early years, and synthetic challenges at times remain daunting. But, fortunately, modem techniques and facilities have enabled significant strides toward taming both the hazards and synthetic uncertainties, In contrast to past environmental problems associated with fluorocarbon refrigerants, the exceptional properties of fluorine in polymers have great environmental value.

Analyse der touristischen Vermarktung,Julia Hafer,travel,de,9783832490324,"Inhaltsangabe:Einleitung: Dem Ruhrgebiet hängt immer noch das Image des staubigen, dreckigen Kohlenpotts an, der geprägt ist von Industriebrachen, Ruinen und verseuchten Flächen. Dass dieses Bild falsch ist, zeigen die diversen Projekte, in denen alte Industrieanlagen einer neuen Nutzung zugeführt wurden und dadurch die Attraktivität der Region maßgeblich gesteigert haben. Durch verschiedene Arten der Inwertsetzung, sei es als Museum, Landmarke, Landschaftspark, origineller Schauplatz kultureller Veranstaltungen oder neuer Standort für gewerbliche Einrichtungen, bekommen diese Relikte des Industriezeitalters eine neue Funktion und helfen, das Image dieser Region aufzuwerten. Diese so genannte Industriekultur ist mittlerweile auch ein wichtiges Alleinstellungsmerkmal in der Vermarktung des Ruhrgebietes als Tourismusdestination geworden. Keine andere Region ist so stark von der Industrie geprägt wie das Ruhrgebiet und bietet somit zahlreiche Ansatzpunkte für die Entdeckung durch Kultur- oder Industrietouristen sowie interessierte Ausflügler aus der Umgebung. So ist die Route der Industriekultur, die 46 Industriekultur-Schauplätze verbindet, ein Beispiel für die touristische Erschließung der Region durch eine Themenroute. Die Vielfalt an industriekulturellen Einrichtungen bringt natürlich auch eine starke Konkurrenz mit sich. Die reine Existenz reicht dabei als Anreiz häufig nicht mehr aus. Denn der Trend im Reise- und Ausflugsverhalten geht weg vom bildungs- hin zum erlebnisorientierten Aufenthalt. Bedingt durch diesen wachsenden Anspruch der Besucher und Touristen an Qualität und Angebotsgestaltung touristischer Einrichtungen auf der einen Seite und starker Preissensibilität auf der anderen Seite, müssen auch Industriekulturdenkmäler diese Bedürfnisse berücksichtigen. Gang der Untersuchung: Diese Arbeit soll herausfinden, welche Aktivitäten bzw. welche Aspekte die Attraktivität der Einrichtung erhöhen und somit die Bedürfnisse der Besucher und Touristen nachhaltig befriedigen.

Tessin,Barbara Schaefer,travel,de,9783770173310,"Der Reiseführer im Taschenbuchformat Schneebedeckte Hänge, gertenschlanke Zypressen und traditionelle Wohnhäuser inmitten rauer Berglandschaften - die Idylle täuscht, denn die kompromisslose Topografie des Tessins hat seinen Bewohnern viel abgetrotzt. Heute kann man in komfortabel umgebauten Ställen wohnen, die Fresken alter Meister in den Tessiner Kirchen bewundern oder über die moderne Fassade des Spielcasinos in Lugano staunen. Dolce vita pur versprechen das Bummeln und Baden am Lago Maggiore und am Lago di Lugano. Ausflugsschiffe gleiten über die Seen, vorbei an verträumten Ufern oder den ins Abendlicht getauchten Brissago-Inseln. Das DuMont Reise-Taschenbuch Tessin stellt die abwechlungsreiche Region auf vielfältige und informative Weise vor. Lust auf Bungee-Jumping, Klettern und Reiten? Die spektakuläre Alpenlandschaft des Tessin lädt zu zahlreichen Aktivitäten ein. Zu jedem Urlaub in der italienischen Schweiz gehören jedenfalls panoramareiche Bergwanderungen, z.B auf den Adula, den höchsten Berg des Kantons. Oben angekommen genießt man die Abgeschiedenheit und Ruhe einer Berghütte und wandert am nächsten Tag gestärkt wieder hinab. Einen Blick in sage und schreibe »hundert Täler« wirft man bei einer Fahrt mit der Centovallibahn, die gemächlich über 83 Brücken bis nach Italien führt. Im Tessin ist Italien um die Ecke und man gerät hier leicht und temperamentvoll ins Schwärmen und Träumen. Die Autorin Barbara Schäfer ist freie Kultur- und Reisejournalistin. Sie schreibt für verschiedene Tageszeitungen und Magazine. Sie wohnt in Berlin, reist sehr viel und wandert für ihr Leben gern. In das Tessin verliebte sie sich schon als Kind während der Ferien mit den Eltern. Später kehrte sie immer wieder zurück, entdeckte jedes Mal Neues und liebt die intensiven Naturerlebnisse in den Bergen und das bezaubernde Licht an den Seen. Man kann sich also von ihr an die Hand nehmen lassen, um gezielt zu den Highlights der Region geführt zu werden. Und zu ihren ganz persönlichen Lieblingsorten! Auf 10 Entdeckungstouren können Sie aktiv Neues entdecken, hinter die Kulissen schauen, eine ganz persönliche Beziehung zum Tessin entwickeln.

Better to Travel,Collin Kelley,travel,en,9780595284092,"""A startling new voice."" -Patricia Smith, Author of Big Towns, Big Talk Collin Kelley's debut, Better To Travel, is a haunting cycle of poetry dispatched from the teeming streets of London and New York to the decadence of Paris and New Orleans. From these far-flung outposts, Kelley deftly and unblinkingly conveys the end of a relationship and the need to escape to ""sights unseen."" Readers have compared Kelley's poetry to the emotional work of Anne Sexton and Sharon Olds. This is confessional poetry in its truest form: raw, uninhibited and unflinching. www.collinkelley.com",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KLgYU76TKr4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Ten Million Steps,M. J. Eberhart,travel,en,9780897329798,"M. J. Eberhart, aka the Nimblewill Nomad, was a 60-year-old retired doctor in January 1998 when he set off on a foot journey that carried him 4,400 miles (twice the length of the Appalachian Trail) from the Florida Keys to the far north of Quebec. Written in a vivid journal style, the author unabashedly recounts the good (friendships with other hikers he met), the bad (sore legs, cutting winds and rain), and the godawful (those dispiriting doubts) aspects of his days of walking along what has since become known as the Eastern Continental Trail (ECT). An amazing tale of self-discovery and insight into the magic that reverberates from intense physical exertion and a high goal, Eberhart’s is the only written account of a thru-hike along the ECT. Covering 16 states and 2 Canadian provinces, Ten Million Steps deftly mixes practical considerations of an almost unimaginable undertaking with the author’s trademark humor and philosophical musings.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZHKIinHAD8sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
