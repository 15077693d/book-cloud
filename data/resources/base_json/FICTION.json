The only mysteries she faces are which play to choose for next season and how to decorate her dining room. But when Jack is hired to investigate a suspicious death at a San Francisco software company, it quickly becomes clear that high-tech has some low-life elements. The only way Charley knows how to help Jack involves doing something no-body thought she would ever do. Charley needs to get a job. It might be a problem that Charley and her band of irregulars from the repertory theater learned everything they know about the workplace from a production of How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying, but that doesn't stop them from going undercover to find a killer. And even though she's only had one day's training in corporate double-speak, Charley isn't worried. Faking it has always been her strong suit. Charley and Jack are starting to get the hang of this marriage thing. If only people would stop talking about babies, introducing them to decorators, and trying to kill them, they might even get to take a honeymoon.",

                "description": "Johnny Bates is incarcerated in the minimum-security correctional facility fighting boredom. One day he learns about an injustice that is being visited upon certain convicts in the maximum-security prison by one of the prison guards. Johnny decides he must be the one to right the wrong. To do that, he must return to maximum-security, to the Walls. Once again in maximum-security, Johnny happily reunites with his old friends from his earlier stay, both convict and guard. He works his way into the place and position he wants and needs in order to complete his mission, while here he learns again the habits of the officers and other convicts and plans the method by which he will put an end to the injustice. Inside the Walls, a lot has changed and Johnny finds himself violently thrust into the most recent problem confronting inmates as well as the prison administration, the problem of juveniles who've been sentenced as adults. The new trouble does serve to keep the attention of the security staff focused away from Johnny, so although it's a distraction, it's not as bad as it seems at first. As he told the warden, \"I'm glad I ain't your biggest problem no more.\" Johnny manages to right the wrong, to wreak the kind of justice (punishment) that will be understood and accepted in prison culture, a culture which seems to be slightly out of step with that of free society, but upon closer inspection is frighteningly similar. The book illustrates that prison is not entirely a war between good (security staff) and bad (convicts), but a way of life with love and hate, fear and humor, and pleasure as well as hard knocks. In prison as well as on the outside, life is what you make of it with the cards you are dealt.",

Pittsburgh psychologist and trauma expert Daniel Rinaldi is called in by the police to treat Treva. Soon an unforeseen series of events plunges the investigating officers, Sergeant Harry Polk, Detective Eleanor Lowrey, and Rinaldi into a vortex of mistaken identity, kidnapping, and surprising revelations about District Attorney Leland Sinclair's gubernatorial campaign. Is Sinclair somehow involved in the bank case? Rinaldi's attention is diverted by the suicide of a young patient and his growing attraction to Eleanor, as the recently-divorced Harry Polk spirals into an alcohol-driven, self-destructive free-fall. Then sudden death threats against Sinclair fuel a new frenzy of accusations and political maneuvering, and Rinaldi begins to make connections. Soon, what he knows - or thinks he knows - will pull him toward a shocking and possibly lethal confrontation.",

Her joy is short-lived, however, when her fiancé announces he's calling off the wedding. Heartbroken, 25-year-old Nell flees New York City for her grandmother's home in quaint Archers Rest. In this small town Eleanor's life revolves around her quilt shop, Someday Quilts, and the members of the shop's quilting circle. When the body of a local handyman known for his flirting is found in the quilt shop, murdered with a pair of quilting scissors, Nell finds herself drawn into the case, and drawn to the handsome police chief. As a pattern of clues begins to emerge, one of the prime suspects is Nell's ex-fiancé, whose arrival in Archers Rest seems suspicious. The ladies of the quilting circle continue to piece together their quilts as Nell unravels the mystery. For quilters and mystery lovers alike, The Lover's Knot is a delightful and promising debut.",

The love story is set against the backdrop of war between Atlantis and Athens—as described by Plato—right before the Earth Changes and deluge occur—as described by Cayce—that destroy the continent of Atlantis. The novel contrasts the ancientcataclysm with the recurrent and fast approaching future tragedy of Earth Changes to this planet.",
